## The Wire Up
In this case I'm using the [Adafruit BME280 Sensor](https://www.adafruit.com/product/2652) to read the Temperature, Barometric Pressure & Humidity. I'll be reading that data using the [I2C](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/i2c/all) capabilities of the RaspberryPi's GPIO pins. This [project](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/build-your-own-weather-station/2) has a good wiring diagram, and writeup on how to connect the BME280 to the RaspberryPi. 

You'll have to ensure that you've [enabled the I2C bus](https://www.raspberrypi-spy.co.uk/2014/11/enabling-the-i2c-interface-on-the-raspberry-pi/) on your RaspberryPi, but once you do, it's pretty straight forward to [initialize](https://github.com/jmayeur/outdoor-aqi/blob/main/enviro_reader.py#L164) the board and [read](https://github.com/jmayeur/outdoor-aqi/blob/main/enviro_reader.py#L189) it. You might notice there's some additional processing of the temperature. In this case there's an attempt to "calibrate" the raw data. Because I built this off of another [really neat project](https://github.com/roscoe81/enviro-monitor/blob/73a8e02923434d8c7555ff91899c8f04f73aaf47/Northcliff_AQI_Monitor_Gen.py#L412) I've kept some of their underlying adjustments. Over time I want to figure out what these actually do, and decide if they make sense for my project. For now though, they're baked into the data stream.

It's also worth noting, that in the case of my "Outside AQI Monitor" I don't use the [Enviro+](https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/enviro?variant=31155658457171). I've just got the raw sensors. The monitor is truly outdoors, so I don't want the LCD screen, or really any unnecessary parts that can break/wear out. While I like the idea of a single board hat, sometimes it's fun to build from pieces.

## The Output
For my purposes I only end up using the Temperature and Humidity in my visualizations. Later on we'll cover how the other bits of raw data are used to derive values from other sensors, but living in the North West, it's either raining or about to rain at least 9 mounths out of the year, so I don't pay to much attention to the barometric pressure readings.
