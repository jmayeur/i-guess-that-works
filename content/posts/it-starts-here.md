# Hi, I'm Jeff

## What
This site exists mostly for me collect things as they fly by. I'm not particularly expert at anything, but I've come to truly enjoy a wide array of "huh; what abouts..." where I take the things I've seen before, hone them, and fit them into the future. Maybe this will only be useful for me. Maybe there's something that can be borrowed and applied by others. In either case it gives me another tool to spelunk through my memory for tidbits I might want to repurpose.

## The Technical
I'll be jotting down thoughts on technology, from what powers this experience ([Hugo](https://gohugo.io)), and how it's all wired together. To other random fiddly bits like Experimentation, caching & the fun of still semi-deterministic world wide web. I don't expect much in the way of tutorials. I've learned over the years that the way I process new concepts isn't always transferable, but I do like prattling on about things like why I'm continually surprised that there's always a [DSL](https://martinfowler.com/dsl.html) at the bottom of where I'm digging, and at the same time why I'd panic if I didn't find one. While this isn't meant as a technical blog, I'm pretty sure I'll use is as a the anchor I'm most weighted by.

## The Harder Bits
To Whom, and What. Ninety percent of my mental capacity, and emotional strife, are bound up in these two barrows. And I do mean All of [barrow's](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/barrow) definitions. The [PB&J Challenge, and it's near cousins](https://www.reddit.com/r/CSEducation/comments/wly2pw/alternative_to_the_make_a_peanut_butter_jelly/) are often used to demonstrate the heart of this battle, but there's subtlety that they can't convey. Certainly communicating intent is fraught, but to me the emotional tango is where the the breath is hurried. 

While it's still now, and there is no AI to do everything, it's people that have to align and innovate. The real work, from what I've experienced is to keep the hearts and minds of the many focused on the next. It's places like this that I hope to mine the most useful of memories. If there were times when I did something well to keep the greater from the lesser, that's a thing I want to borrow and replay.

## Else
I've always been good at starting things, which is key to my "not expert at anything" claim. I can do many things well enough to have a seat at the table, but I tend to rise, wander and forget my way back. I'm hopeful I'll be somewhat stickier with this task, it is something I actually enjoy, and that my yet just be enough.
