I\u0026rsquo;m not particularly expert at anything, but I\u0026rsquo;ve come to truly enjoy a wide array of \u0026ldquo;huh; what abouts\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; where I take the things I\u0026rsquo;ve seen before, hone them, and fit them into the future. Maybe this will only be useful for me. Maybe there\u0026rsquo;s something that can be borrowed and applied by others. In either case it gives me another tool to spelunk through my memory for tidbits I might want to repurpose.\nThe Technical I\u0026rsquo;ll be jotting down thoughts on technology, from what powers this experience (Hugo), and how it\u0026rsquo;s all wired together. To other random fiddly bits like Experimentation, caching \u0026amp; the fun of still semi-deterministic world wide web. I don\u0026rsquo;t expect much in the way of tutorials. I\u0026rsquo;ve learned over the years that the way I process new concepts isn\u0026rsquo;t always transferable, but I do like prattling on about things like why I\u0026rsquo;m continually surprised that there\u0026rsquo;s always a DSL at the bottom of where I\u0026rsquo;m digging, and at the same time why I\u0026rsquo;d panic if I didn\u0026rsquo;t find one. While this isn\u0026rsquo;t meant as a technical blog, I\u0026rsquo;m pretty sure I\u0026rsquo;ll use is as a the anchor I\u0026rsquo;m most weighted by.\nThe Harder Bits To Whom, and What. Ninety percent of my mental capacity, and emotional strife, are bound up in these two barrows. And I do mean All of barrow\u0026rsquo;s definitions. The PB\u0026amp;J Challenge, and it\u0026rsquo;s near cousins are often used to demonstrate the heart of this battle, but there\u0026rsquo;s subtlety that they can\u0026rsquo;t convey. Certainly communicating intent is fraught, but to me the emotional tango is where the the breath is hurried.\nWhile it\u0026rsquo;s still now, and there is no AI to do everything, it\u0026rsquo;s people that have to align and innovate. The real work, from what I\u0026rsquo;ve experienced is to keep the hearts and minds of the many focused on the next. It\u0026rsquo;s places like this that I hope to mine the most useful of memories. If there were times when I did something well to keep the greater from the lesser, that\u0026rsquo;s a thing I want to borrow and replay.\nElse I\u0026rsquo;ve always been good at starting things, which is key to my \u0026ldquo;not expert at anything\u0026rdquo; claim. I can do many things well enough to have a seat at the table, but I tend to rise, wander and forget my way back. I\u0026rsquo;m hopeful I\u0026rsquo;ll be somewhat stickier with this task, it is something I actually enjoy, and that my yet just be enough.\nQOTD “Watch out he\u0026rsquo;s winding the watch of his wit, by and by it will strike.” ― William Shakespeare, The Tempest\n","link":"http://localhost:1313/posts/it-starts-here/","section":"posts","tags":["Hugo","DSL"],"title":"It Starts Here"},{"body":"","link":"http://localhost:1313/tags/","section":"tags","tags":null,"title":"Tags"},{"body":"","link":"http://localhost:1313/categories/","section":"categories","tags":null,"title":"Categories"},{"body":"","link":"http://localhost:1313/series/","section":"series","tags":null,"title":"Series"}]
