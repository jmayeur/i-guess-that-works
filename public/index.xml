            Brief Like most people, I&amp;rsquo;m mostly wrong. I operate under the assumption that if I&amp;rsquo;m lucky I&amp;rsquo;m right 25% of time, pretty close another 25%, not terribly wrong 25% more, and holy hell how did you come up with that for the biggest 25%. I&amp;rsquo;m not really a fan of the wanning move-fast-and-break-things mantra, but I know I have to be okay with getting things wrong.
A Great Weakness I&amp;rsquo;m someone who&amp;rsquo;s nature is to be terrified of being wrong.

            Sum it up, and be quick. The Basics Go HTML Template - This is the basic language that is used to inject dynamic content and logic into an otherwise static HTML Document Hugo Templates - Hugo uses the Go HTML Template to structure the a site, from the home page, to sub pages, to navigation, all of the facets of a Huge Site are driven through these templates Hugo Clarity&amp;rsquo;s Excerpt - This is the template I&amp;rsquo;m interested in, it renders the &amp;ldquo;Summary&amp;rdquo; that shows up on the root of this blog.

            Hi, I&amp;rsquo;m Jeff What This site exists mostly for me collect things as they fly by. I&amp;rsquo;m not particularly expert at anything, but I&amp;rsquo;ve come to truly enjoy a wide array of &amp;ldquo;huh; what abouts&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo; where I take the things I&amp;rsquo;ve seen before, hone them, and fit them into the future. Maybe this will only be useful for me. Maybe there&amp;rsquo;s something that can be borrowed and applied by others. In either case it gives me another tool to spelunk through my memory for tidbits I might want to repurpose.
